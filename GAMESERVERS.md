#VALUES/PRINCIPLES
- [ ] Restrict user's choices - too many options complicate the user interaction with the game.
- [ ] Landing page - board - or two buttons (1p or 2p)
- [ ] We recognize that the the better design would be to have an additional landing page, but time did not allow us to carry this out
- [ ] What would the user want(game server) vs how would the user want it(clear directions)
- [ ] Simplicity
- [ ] Familiar feel
- [ ] What sets us apart?

#RESOURCES

- [ ] Existing game databases or platforms (i.e. steam, etc)
- [ ] Remote user interviews
- [ ] Chat software or framework

#BLUEPRINT
- [ ] Set up database to scale?
- [ ] Set up server with hosting service
- [ ] Use some node framework, such as gameapi-node.js, to set up communication between client-side and server-side
