#BRAINSTORM LIST
- [ ] User Friendly: a good color scheme,
- [ ] User Experience (UX) -

#SPECIFIC EXAMPLES/DECISIONS
- [ ] How to notify user that the game is over(alert or update div?)
- [ ] Do we show the score? Where?

#VALUES/PRINCIPLES
- [ ] Restrict user's choices - too many options complicate the user interaction with the game.
- [ ] Landing page - board - or two buttons (1p or 2p)
- [ ] We recognize that the the better design would be to have an additional landing page, but time did not allow us to carry this out
- [ ] What would the user want(game server) vs how would the user want it(clear directions)
- [ ] Simplicity
- [ ] Familiar feel
- [ ] What sets us apart?

#RESOURCES
- [ ] DOET: Design Of Everyday Things. --> Using existing schema
- [ ] Other sites that we really enjoy - find 7 online tic-tac-toe websites, and compare and create a rubric of reviews
- [ ] Having lots of user interviews - non-functional (wire-frame) finished product, have user use the product and talk aloud while using and record the entire session.
- [ ] Install software that records every click and is capable of playback (keystroke and mouse recorder) (Also, look into sites that connect app to user reviews)
